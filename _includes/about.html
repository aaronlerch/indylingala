      <p>A group of people interested in the Lingala language and Congolese culture.</p>

      <p>You! Your friends! Anybody! We&rsquo;re open to anyone who wants to come.</p>
      <p>You might be a long time Lingala-speaker, or maybe hardly know about it at all but are interested. All are welcome to enjoy, learn, teach, and connect.</p>

      <h3>Eza wapi na tango nini? <small>Where and when is it?</small></h3>
      <p>The club hasn't started yet, we are still getting the word out and gathering a list of interested folks. We'll meet in Indianapolis, likely on the northeast side of town, but that depends on who's in the club and where they live.<p>
      <p>If you're interested, <a href="http://eepurl.com/Kiu5D">sign up for the newsletter</a> to get information about our first meeting!<p>

      <p><img class="me" src="/assets/img/aaronlerch.jpg" style="float:left;" /><span>The group is organized by me, Aaron Lerch. And yes, I'm as goofy as I look in this picture. <em>Ya solo.</em> I'm a software engineer, <a href="http://onlymykids.tumblr.com/about" target="_blank">a parent to 4</a> (including my daughter from the D.R.C.) and I love Lingala, the Congolese people, and their culture.</span></p>
